Fly that freak flag high, Aquarius. You may look like an all-American girl on the surface (or not), but behind that distressed-denim jacket beats the heart of a true bohemian. You have the unique ability to combine logic and creativity into pure genius. Few people understand your vision when you simply talk about it. Get into action. Once a tangible product has been brought forth, you catapult to the heights of popularity and respect, like barrier-smashing talk-show queens Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres. You have an innate concern for human rightsâ€”especially when it comes to fighting for the underdog. Find an appropriate outlet for your inner revolutionary, the more public the better. As an air sign, you're a gifted communicator who is capable of reaching the masses with your message. Like Aquarius author Alice Walker and comedian Chris Rock, your world vision can be funneled through moving works of fiction or politically charged comedy. Few people can match you when it comes to humor, which also makes you popular with a broad spectrum of people. As the sign that rules groups, you thrive in a collaborative environment, managing your teammates with the motivation of a cheerleading captain.
