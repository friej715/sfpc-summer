Lord, said David, since you do not need us, why did you create these two worlds?
Reality replied: O prisoner of time, I was a secret treasure of kindness and generosity, and I wished this treasure to be known, so I created a mirror: its shining face, the heart; its darkened back, the world; The back would please you if you've never seen the face.
Has anyone ever produced a mirror out of mud and straw? Yet clean away the mud and straw,  and a mirror might be revealed.
Until the juice ferments a while in the cask, it isn't wine. If you wish your heart to be bright, you must do a little work.
My King addressed the soul of my flesh: You return just as you left. Where are the traces of my gifts?
We know that alchemy transforms copper into gold. This Sun doesn't want a crown or robe from God's grace. He is a hat to a hundred bald men, a covering for ten who were naked.
Jesus sat humbly on the back of an ass, my child! How could a zephyr ride an ass? Spirit, find your way, in seeking lowness like a stream. Reason, tread the path of selflessness into eternity.
Remember God so much that you are forgotten. Let the caller and the called disappear; be lost in the Call.
